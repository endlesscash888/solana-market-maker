## 🎯 Project Mission

Design and deploy an **ultra-fast, production-grade market-making bot** for Solana-based bonding-curve exchanges, optimized for **Pump.fun**. The architecture balances **latency-sensitive execution**, **cost-effective infrastructure**, and **modular expansion**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Technologies

- **Solana SDKs**: `@solana/web3.js`, `@pump-fun/pump-sdk`, `@jito-ts/core`, `@helius-labs/sdk`
- **Bundled execution**: Jito Block Engine integration
- **Observability**: Grafana, Prometheus, optional Loki
- **Bot logic**: TypeScript/Node.js with modular CLI + daemon
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, WSL2, GitHub Actions CI

---

## 📦 Architecture Highlights

- 🔹 **Sub-200ms execution latency** on bonding curve
- 🔹 Isolated wallet managers with secure key handling
- 🔹 Modular Buy/Sell engines with configurable strategies
- 🔹 Real-time metrics and alerts
- 🔹 CLI + Telegram-based command interface
