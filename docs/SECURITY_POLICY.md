# ‚úÖ Security Policy: Solana Market-Making Bot Deployment

## Purpose

This policy defines the approved sources of software, SDKs, Docker containers, and academic references used in the development and deployment of the Solana-based Pump.fun market-making bot. It enforces security best practices and eliminates the risk of integrating unknown, malicious, or backdoored code.

## üéØ Enforcement Goals

* Ensure all production and development dependencies are secure, traceable, and auditable
* Prevent accidental use of unsafe libraries, forked SDKs, or copied unvetted code
* Establish a zero-tolerance policy for mixing trusted and untrusted components in the same runtime

All development team members and AI copilots (Claude, Perplexity, Grok) must adhere to this policy throughout all phases of the project lifecycle.
